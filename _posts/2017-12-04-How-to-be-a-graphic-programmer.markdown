## [How to Learn Game/Graphics Programming]

* Pay Attention in math class: Calculus, Vector and Geometry
* Pay Attention in programming class
* Practice makes perfect
* Build yourself a good library

>A lot of things might not make perfect sense at first, or not seem applicable, 
>but try to learn everything you can. You'll need it all. 
>Plus, the more you know, the easier it will get in the future to tie new ideas together. 
>You'll never have the chance again to sit there for an hour a day and have someone EXPLAIN 
>to you how to do all this stuff - it'll be you and a book, and a lot of hair-pulling.

>What will make you a good programmer is your ability to wield complex data structures for 
>modeling physics or crazy algorithms for AI. 

## [How to become a Graphics Programmer in the games industry]

* Know the Hardware
* Good Math Skills
* Passion for computer graphics
* Performance Analysis and Optimization

> getting all of the fancy effects to run at target frame rate is often the trickier part

>There are plenty of fascinating research papers (e.g. current SIGGRAPH publications), 
>developer talks (e.g. GDC presentations) and technical blogs available on the internet, 
>so it should be pretty easy to find something that interests you. 
>Make sure to check out the blogs of fellow Rendering Engineers for some really inspiring articles!

>Of course implementing an algorithm is the best way to learn about it, 
>plus it gives you something to talk about in an interview. 
>Writing a cool graphics demo also helps you to practice your skills and most of all it is a lot of fun.

> Graphics analysis tool: PIX, gDebuufer, Intel's GPA, Nvidia Nsight

>The Beginner's Checklist
>
> 1. Check out the excellent #AltDevBlog article “So you want to be a Graphics Programmer” by Keith Judge
> 2. Read " Real-Time Rendering (Third Edition)"
> 3. Refresh your math with the book "3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development"
> 4. Calculate the intersection between a ray and a sphere (on a piece of paper!)
> 5. Program a ray-tracer
> 6. Implement a SIGGRAPH paper
> 7. Use PIX to debug and optimize your demo
> 8. Write an article about your experience writing the demo
> 9. Check out what fellow Graphics Programmers are excited about
